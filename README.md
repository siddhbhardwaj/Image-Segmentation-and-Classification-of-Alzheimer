# Image-Segmentation-and-Classification-of-Alzheimer

PUBLISHED RESEARCH WORK, DONOT COPY, CITE FOR USAGE OF WORK

In this innovative project, we have developed a robust and comprehensive solution for analyzing Alzheimer's disease-related images. Our approach combines advanced techniques in medical image analysis to provide accurate segmentation and insightful classification.

Utilizing the power of overlaying analysis and the U-Net architecture, our system achieves precise image segmentation, effectively isolating regions of interest within Alzheimer's images. The overlaying analysis enhances the segmentation process by incorporating contextual information, resulting in highly detailed segmentations that capture subtle nuances in the data. 
Subsequently, we employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on segemented images of Overlaying images to classify the segmented regions.

We implement an Ensemble classification strategy on the outcomes of the U-Net image segmentation. This ensemble approach combines the outputs of multiple classification models, enhancing the overall accuracy and robustness of the disease classification. By fusing the insights from various classification models, we achieve a holistic perspective on the data, resulting in more reliable and insightful predictions.
